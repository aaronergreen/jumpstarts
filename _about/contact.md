**Featured Startups must apply**: <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">umpStarts strip away self-delusion and force an objective assessment of your social venture’s current status.</span>

**Unfortunately, in our experience**, most founders don’t really want to read a Truth Memo about their venture:

*   so please be honest with yourself (and with us) because this <u>isn’t</u> a feel-good safe-space for semi-committed hobbyists or also-ran's.

*   and <u>don’t</u> sit-on-the-fence about applying: once we get to 20 Featured Startups in 2017 we are done — and we <u>won’t</u> offer JumpStarts again.

**Click the button below** to see if we’re on the same page. Then we’ll follow-up within 24hrs to schedule a face-to-face session that fully explains the value and the <u>commitment</u> required by you + by us.
