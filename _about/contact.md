**Featured Startups must apply**: JumpStarts strip away self-delusion and force an <u>objective assessment</u> of your social venture’s current status.

**Unfortunately, in our experience**, most founders don’t really want to read a Truth Memo about their venture:

*   so please be honest with yourself (and with us) because this <u>isn’t</u> a feel-good safe-space for the semi-committed.

*   once we get to 20 Featured Startups in 2017 we are done — and we <u>won’t</u> offer JumpStarts again.

**Let's figure out if we're all on the same page.**
