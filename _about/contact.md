**Featured Startups must apply**: because we ask <u>great questions</u> that will make you objectively assess your venture, the application process <u>in-and-of-itself</u> is a highly-valuable exercise for founders.  

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">**Unfortunately, in our experience**, </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">most founders don’t really want to read a Truth Memo about their venture:</span>

*   so please be honest with yourself (and with us) because this <u>isn’t</u> a feel-good safe-space for semi-committed hobbyists or also-ran's.  

*   and <u>don’t</u> sit-on-the-fence about applying: once we get to 20 Featured Startups in 2017 we are done — and we <u>won’t</u> offer JumpStarts again.  

**Click the button below** to see if we’re on the same page. Then we’ll follow-up within 24hrs to schedule a face-to-face session that fully explains the value and the <u>commitment</u> required by you + by us.
