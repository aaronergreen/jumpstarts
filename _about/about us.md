    <h3>Louis</h3>
      <p class="f6 lh-copy measure-wide">
      Louis believes that social venture under-performance can almost always be traced back to one-of-two causes: (1) an insufficiently developed Problem/Solution construct and/or (2) an organizational Business/Change Model that is broken, incomplete, or under-developed.<br><br>

      Louis has also raised tens-of-millions for education and scientific research — and has a for-profit background in storytelling, marketing, branding, and systems development. His conviction in the power of data-driven insights and scientific methodologies to catalyze change began at the University of Chicago where he studied mathematics and cognitive science.<br><br>

      His life-long interest in public/private cross-sector partnerships was honed while completing his Masters at NYU's Heyman Center for Philanthropy.

    <h3>Aaron</h3>
      <p class="f6 lh-copy measure-wide" >
      Throughout the social sector, Aaron has observed that scale-related organizational problems are consistently the consequence of incomplete and underdeveloped business models — leading him to conclude that massively scalable solutions can only be produced by for-profit social ventures.<br><br>
      He has researched and written about technology’s exponential-growth potential, and is passionate about helping social entrepreneurs to leverage Exponential Technologies — like artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and data science — in order to create sustainable impact on a global scale.
