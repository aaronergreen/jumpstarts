    <h3>Aaron</h3>
      <p class="f6 lh-copy measure-wide" >
      Aaron served 10-years in the U.S. Marine Corps, where he learned Arabic while watching music videos with Iraqi soldiers.<br><br>
      Later, after 5-years in the non-profit sector, Aaron was struck by how consistently he encountered scale-related organizational problems that could consistently be traced back to incomplete and underdeveloped non-profit business models — leading him to conclude that genuinely stable solutions can only be produced by for-profit social ventures.<br><br>
      He has researched and written about technology’s power to drive exponential growth, and is passionate about helping social entrepreneurs harness technological insights and advances in order to create sustainable impact on a global scale.
