    <h3>Aaron</h3>
      <p class="f6 lh-copy measure-wide" >
    Aaron served 10 years in the U.S. Marine Corps, where during his first deployment to Iraq learned Arabic while watching music videos with Iraqi soldiers. Later he went into the nonprofit sector but after seeing repeated problems with their business models, he started to look at ways social ventures could impact the world in ways nonprofits canâ€™t. He has researched and written about the power of exponential growth in technology and is passionate about helping social entrepreneurs harness it to create impact on a global level.
