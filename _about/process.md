  section_copy: "**37-hrs of Pre-Event Prep**\n\nKey to the effectiveness of the JumpStart
    experience is the <u>37hrs of Prep</u> prior to the event.  \n\nAcross <u>seven
    two-hour sessions</u> (plus between-session homework), the Featured Startupâ€™s
    Business/Change Model is systematically dissected, analyzed, and diagnosed.  \n\nThe
    result is a high-value Goldilox Problem: from which 7 Experts will then produce
    <u>3 Actionable Solutions</u>.\n\n**Six-Months of Ongoing Support**\n\nPost-event,
    the Featured Startup <u>receives twice-monthly Support Sessions</u> (1hr per session)
    to ensure <u>continued progress</u> in implementing the 3 Actionable Solutions.\n\n**Outcomes
    Reporting Event**\n\nSix-months later, the Featured Startup <u>returns</u> to
    the Expert Panel for an Outcomes Reporting Event, where the tangible results of
    the Actionable Solutions are objectively assessed.  \n\nPrior to the event, the
    Featured Startup receives an additional <u>10hrs of prep support</u>.\n\n**Case
    Study**\n\nThe final output of the JumpStart process is a <u>Case Study</u> describing:\n\n-
    What Worked?\n- What Didn't?\n- What Was Learned?\n- General recommendations for
    Social Startup design. "
