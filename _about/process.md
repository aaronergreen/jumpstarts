  section_copy: "**37hrs of Pre-Event Prep**\n\nKey to the effectiveness of the JumpStart
    experience is the 37hrs of Prep Time that take place before the actual JumpStart.
    Across seven two-hour sessions (plus between-session homework), the Featured Startup’s
    Business/Change Model is systematically dissected, analyzed, and diagnosed. This
    rigorous analysis in turn produces a high-value Goldilox Problem: which seven
    Experts will then focus upon in order to produce three Actionable Solutions.\n\n**Six-Months
    of Ongoing Support**\n\nPost-JumpStart, the Featured Startup receives twice-monthly
    Support Sessions (2 one-hour sessions) to ensure continued progress in implementing
    and adapting the Expert Panel’s 3 Actionable Solutions.\n\n**Outcomes Reporting
    Event**\n\nSix-months later, the Featured Startup returns to the Expert Panel
    in order to report on Solutions Outcomes + Lessons Learned. The Featured Startup
    receives an additional 10hrs of prep support prior to the Outcomes Reporting Event.\n\n**Case
    Study**\n\nThe entire six-month arc is captured and published in a Case Study
    that describes:\n\n- What Worked?\n- What Didn't?\n- What Was Learned?\n- Recommendations
    for Future Applications. "
