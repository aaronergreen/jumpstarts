    experience is the <a>37hrs of Prep</a> prior to the event.  \n\nAcross <a>seven
    two-hour sessions</a> (plus between-session homework), the Featured Startup’s
    Business/Change Model is systematically dissected, analyzed, and diagnosed.  \n\nThe
    result is a high-value <a>Goldilox Problem</a>: from which 7 Experts will then
    produce <a>three Actionable Solutions</a>.\n\n**Six-Months of Ongoing Support**\n\nPost-JumpStart,
    the Featured Startup receives twice-monthly Support Sessions (2 one-hour sessions)
    to ensure continued progress in implementing and adapting the Expert Panel’s 3
    Actionable Solutions.\n\n**Outcomes Reporting Event**\n\nSix-months later, the
    Featured Startup returns to the Expert Panel in order to report on Solutions Outcomes
    + Lessons Learned. The Featured Startup receives an additional 10hrs of prep support
    prior to the Outcomes Reporting Event.\n\n**Case Study**\n\nThe entire six-month
    arc is captured and published in a Case Study that describes:\n\n- What Worked?\n-
    What Didn't?\n- What Was Learned?\n- Recommendations for Future Applications. "
