  **37hrs of Pre-Event Prep**
Key to the effectiveness of the JumpStart experience is the 37hrs of Prep Time that take place before the actual JumpStart.
Across seven two-hour sessions (plus between-session homework), the Featured Startup’s Business/Change Model is systematically dissected, analyzed, and diagnosed.
This rigorous analysis in turn produces a high-value Goldilox Problem: which seven Experts will then focus upon in order to produce three Actionable Solutions.

Six-Months of Ongoing Support
Post-JumpStart, the Featured Startup receives twice-monthly Support Sessions (2 one-hour sessions) to ensure continued progress in implementing and adapting the Expert Panel’s 3 Actionable Solutions.

Outcomes Reporting Event
Six-months later, the Featured Startup returns to the Expert Panel in order to report on Solutions Outcomes + Lessons Learned.
The Featured Startup receives an additional 10hrs of prep support prior to the Outcomes Reporting Event.

Case Study
The entire six-month arc is captured and published in a Case Study that describes:
* What Worked?
* What Didn't?
* What Was Learned?
* Recommendations for Future Applications.
