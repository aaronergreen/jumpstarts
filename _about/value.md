    JumpStarts bring together individual experts with their like-minded colleagues in order to collaboratively solve practical problems for social startups.

    But the greater payoff is the contribution made to a larger shared understanding within a growing network of Experts and Founders of how to build social startups that are uncommonly effective engines of change.
