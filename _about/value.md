Unlike brainstorming sessions, JumpStarts help the founders of promising Social Startups <u>diagnose</u> and <u>address</u> what is broken, missing, or under-developed in their Business/Change Models.  

The end-goal of the JumpStart session is to produce <u>3 Actionable Solutions</u> for the Featured Social Startup = three recipes-for-action with <u>discrete, executable steps</u>.
