    and address what is broken, missing, or under-developed in their Business/Change
    Models. The end-goal of the JumpStart session is to produce <u>3 Actionable
    Solutions</u> for the Featured Social Startup. An ''Actionable Solution'' describes
    a recipe-for-action: <u>a sequence of discrete, executable steps</u>.'

    JumpStarts bring together individual experts with their like-minded colleagues in order to collaboratively solve practical problems for social startups.

    But the greater payoff is the contribution made to a larger shared understanding within a growing network of Experts and Founders of how to build social startups that are uncommonly effective engines of change.
