Unlike brainstorming sessions, JumpStarts help the founders of promising Social Startups <u>diagnose</u> and <u>address</u> what is broken, missing, or under-developed in their Business/Change Models.

**The JumpStart process has three end-goals:**  

1.  Producing <u>3 Actionable Solutions</u> for the Featured Social Startup — i.e. three recipes-for-action with <u>discrete, executable steps</u>.
2.  <u>Six-months of support</u> in applying the Actionable Solutions.  

3.  Concluding <u>case studies</u> that identify what worked, what <u>didn’t</u>, and what <u>lessons</u> were learned.
