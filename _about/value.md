    and <u>address</u> what is broken, missing, or under-developed in their Business/Change
    Models. \n\nThe end-goal of the JumpStart session is to produce <u>3 Actionable

    JumpStarts bring together <u>groups of subject-matter experts</u> in order to collaboratively solve <u>practical problems</u> for specific social startups.

    But the greater payoff is the contribution made to a larger shared understanding about <u>how to build social startups</u> which become uncommonly effective engines of change.

JumpStarts provide <u>unique value</u> to both Founders + Experts.
