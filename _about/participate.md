    that will make you objectively assess your venture, the application process <u>in-and-of-itself</u>
    is a highly-valuable experience for founders.\n\n**5 Venture Questions:**\nWe
    start by asking you the questions below to establish if we're <u>on the same page</u>.\nIf
    so, we schedule a <u>face-to-face session</u> where we verify fit and the complete
    process:\n\n(1a) What is <u>The Problem</u>?  (in 1 sentence only)  \n(1b) What
    is <u>Your Solution</u>?  (in 1 sentence only)\n\n(2) Who is your <u>Early Adopter</u>
    — and how many of them are <u>paying</u> you now?\n\n(3) How <u>fast</u> are you
    currently growing — measured <u>how</u>?\n\n(4) How does your venture reconcile
    <u>Purpose</u> and <u>Profit</u>?\n\n(5) What’s keeping you up at night — what’s
    stopping you?\n\n \n"
