    **Featured Startups must apply:** because we ask <u>great questions</u> that will make you objectively assess your venture, the application process <u>in-and-of-itself</u> is a highly-valuable experience for founders.

    **Venture Questions:**
    We start by asking you a few quick questions to establish if we're <u>on the same page</u>.
    If so, we schedule a <u>face-to-face session</u> where we verify fit and the complete process:

    variety of competencies — click below to let us know <u>yours</u>!"
