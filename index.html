  copy: JumpStarts are <u>monthly problem-solving sessions</u> that employ guided
    group discussion (3hrs) to unpack and to solve a highly-focused <u>strategic/operational
    business challenge</u> — a challenge that must be practically resolved before
    the Featured Startup can progress to its next stage of sustainable growth.

      Startup (non-profit, for-profit, benefit corp., hybrid)    \n7 Expert Panelists

      do we solve or accomplish ___________?”  \n**Choosing Between Alternatives**:

  - subsection_title: Value for Founders
    subsection_copy: 'JumpStarts help the founders of promising Social Startups diagnose
      and address what is broken, missing, or under-developed in their Business/Change
      Models. The end-goal of the JumpStart session is to produce <u>3 Actionable
      Solutions</u> for the Featured Social Startup. An ''Actionable Solution'' describes
      a recipe-for-action: <u>a sequence of discrete, executable steps</u>.'
  - title: Value for Experts
    subsection_copy: |-
      JumpStarts bring together individual experts with their like-minded colleagues in order to collaboratively solve practical problems for social startups.

      But the greater payoff is the contribution made to a larger shared understanding within a growing network of Experts and Founders of how to build social startups that are uncommonly effective engines of change.

    subsection_copy: "What's Stopping You?   \nFeatured Startups must apply: because
      we ask great questions that will make you objectively assess your venture, the

      same page.  \nIf so, we schedule a face-to-face where we explain the complete
